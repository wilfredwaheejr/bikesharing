## Summary
### Summary and Next Steps
The largest takeaway from the data is that most of the rides are taken by men and that most of the subscribers are men. The data used investigates bike-sharing in New York City where the gender ratio is 94 men to 100 women or 94:100 which is lower than Des Moines and the national average (97:100) according to census data. However, Des Moines is significantly less populated than New York City and may have different age demographics as well. Two additional visualizations that would prove useful would be the age groups of bike riders, as well as the age and gender of bike riders to see how those characteristics affect the data.
